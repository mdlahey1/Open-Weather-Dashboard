# Open-Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a weather application that utilizes the Open Weather API to fetch current weather and future weather data based on the city the user inputs in a dashboard format. The goal of the project was to get familiar with using server-side APIs in order to dynamically update a dashboard. The weather dashboard originally displays a basic search card/submit button that allows the user to input any city in the world. Once a city is searched for the application will display the current weather for that city as well a future five day forecast displaying the temperature, wind, and humidity. Additionally the application displays a search history with clickable buttons to return to that city's weather data if the user so chooses.
